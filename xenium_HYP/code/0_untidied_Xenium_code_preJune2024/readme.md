Hi Kasper,

Most of the code for data processing should be created in April, as I was only working on polishing figures in May.

I just copied and pasted the current files in my laptop for this project into "/Xenium_HYP/Code_notCleaned/June11_2024", which includes all code used from the beginning of this project.

For the code involved in the most recent analysis:

(1) The code for processing the raw data into seurat/spe object is in “/Xenium_HYP/Code_notCleaned/June11_2024/xenium_1st_run/withQC/“ (1st run data processing) and "/Xenium_HYP/Code_notCleaned/June11_2024/xenium_2nd_run/withQC" (2nd run data processing).

(2) For the rest of analysis (joint analysis of the two runs using the seurat/spe object), the code are in "/Xenium_HYP/Code_notCleaned/June11_2024/xenium_2runs_together/withQC/cellLevel/lambda0/"

Best,
Yi
