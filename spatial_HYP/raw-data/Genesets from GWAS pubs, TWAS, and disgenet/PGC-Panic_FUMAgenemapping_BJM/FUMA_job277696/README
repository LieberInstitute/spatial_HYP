	Please refer the online tutorial for details

# The file contains significant interactions of user defined data or user uploaded data.
######################
GenomicLocus : Index of genomic loci where the significant interaction is overlapped.
region1 : One end of significant chromatin interaction which overlap with at least one candidate SNPs in one of the genomic risk loci.

ciMapFilt : If the interaction used for mapping 1, otherwise 0. It can be 0 due to one of the following reasons.
	1) region 2 is not mapped to any gene
	2) genes mapped by region 2 are not user selected gene type (such as protein coding genes)
	3) SNPs overlapping region 1 are filtered out by other functional filtering such as CADD score
	4) When filtering based on enhancer and/or promoter is activated, either region 1 is not overlapping with any enhancer or region 2 is not overlapping with any promoter
