SHEET - ST12 all criteria	
Column	Description
FINEMAPk3.5	genes where a FINEMAP credible variant maps at clumps with k<3.5
nonsynPP0.10	genes containing a non-synonymous variant with a posterior probability (PP) of >0.10 at clumps with k<3.5
UTRPP0.10	genes containing an UTR variants with a PP of >0.1 at clumps with k<3.5
k3.5singleGene	"genes where all variants within a 95% set fall within the transcript boundaries of a single gene, and clump has <k3.5"
SMRpsych	genes which are genome-wide significant in PsychENCODE tissue SMR analysis
SMRfetal	genes which are genome-wide significant in fetal tissue SMR analysis
SMRblood	genes which are genome-wide significant in eQTLgen blood tissue SMR analysis and replicate in PsychENCODE
SMRmap	SMR genes where credible eQTLs capture >50% of FINEMAP PP
SMRsingleGene	SMR genes which are in single gene loci
HI.C.SMR	"gene is an SMR gene (psych, fetal or blood) and has a high confidence Hi-C interaction (its promoter) through a contact with a credible SNP"
